### Code Editor and Compiler

This project is a web-based code editor and compiler built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It allows users to write, edit, and compile code seamlessly within the application.

### Key Features

- *React.js*: Provides the dynamic user interface for the code editor, enabling a responsive and interactive experience.
- *Node.js*: Handles the backend logic, compiling, and executing code submitted by users.
- *Monaco Editor*: A powerful code editor integrated into the application, offering syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and code navigation.
- *Axios*: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend, sending code for compilation and retrieving the results.
- *Spinner*: A visual loading indicator that improves user experience by displaying while code is being compiled.
